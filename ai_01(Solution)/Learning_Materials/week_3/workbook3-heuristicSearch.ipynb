    "## Introduction\n",
    "This practical uses a simple easy-to-visualise optimisation problem to illustrate the properties of different search algorithms.\n",
    "The problem is this:\n",
    "- We are given  a model of a problem in terms of a graph  - which we can visualise as a maze.\n",
    "- We are given a starting position and the desired endpoint (goal)\n",
    "- The problem is to find a sequence of inputs that takes us from the start to the goal, preferably in as few moves as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims of this practical\n",
    "1. To give you the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding by implementing the code needed to create different search algorithms.\n",
    "2. To give you experience of comparing the behaviour of different search algorithms.\n",
    "3. To give you experience of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm for a problem ( in this case path-planning) by creating different instances of a problem (mazes) to *stress-test* different methods. \n",

    "we discussed how to create different algorithms, with different behaviours, just by adapting the function **select_and_move_from_openlist()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In last week's lab session you should have:\n",
    "1. Got familiar with a general implementation framework we provided with classes for:\n",
    "  - **SingleMemberSearch**\n",
    "  - **Problem**\n",
    "  - **CandidateSolution**\n",
    "2. Created your own search subclasses **DepthfirstSearch** and **BreadthFirstSearch** \n",
    "  - by over-riding the function **select_and_move_from_openlist()**\n",
    "3. Applied those algorithms to two sublasses of problem: **CombinationLock** and **FoxChickenGrain**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## This week\n",
    "You will extend that work to:\n",
    "1. Create your own implementations of the algorithms **LocalSearch**, **BestFirstSearch**, and **AStarSearch**\n",
    "2. Test their behaviour on a simple maze problem \n",
    "   because it is easy to visualise, and  many search graphs can be represented as  mazes.\n",
    "3. **Test your understanding** by making mazes that *break* different algorithms."
